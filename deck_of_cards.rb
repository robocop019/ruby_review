# 1. Write out the Card and Deck classes to make the program work. The Deck class should hold a list of Card instances.
# 2. Change the program to use multiple choice questions. The Card class should be responsible for checking the answer.
# 3. CHALLENGE: Change the program to allow the user to retry once if they get the wrong answer.
# 4. CHALLENGE: Change the program to keep track of number right/wrong and give a score at the end.
# 5. CHALLENGE: Change the program to give the user the choice at the end of the game to retry the cards they got wrong.
# 6. CHALLENGE: Change the interface with better prompts, ASCII art, etc. Be as creative as you'd like!
